# CMD line shows the command line used to generate this output
# DEF lines define expressions for all tested thresholds
# FLT* lines report numbers for every threshold and every sample:
#   1) filter id
#   2) sample
#   3) number of genotypes which pass the filter
#   4) number of non-reference genotypes
#   5) number of homozygous ref genotypes (0/0 or 0)
#   6) number of homozygous alt genotypes (1/1, 2/2, etc)
#   7) number of heterozygous genotypes (0/1, 1/2, etc)
#   8) number of hemizygous genotypes (0, 1, etc)
#   9) number of SNVs
#   10) number of indels
#   11) number of singletons
#   12) number of missing genotypes (./., ., ./0, etc)
#   13) number of transitions (alt het genotypes such as "1/2" are counted twice)
#   14) number of transversions (alt het genotypes such as "1/2" are counted twice)
#   15) overall ts/tv
# SITE* lines report numbers for every threshold:
#   1) filter id
#   2) number of sites which pass the filter
#   3) number of SNVs
#   4) number of indels
#   5) number of singletons
#   6) number of transitions (counted at most once at multiallelic sites)
#   7) number of transversions (counted at most once at multiallelic sites)
#   8) overall ts/tv
